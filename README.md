# AI-Assisted Python Package Template

A minimal, streamlined template for scientists who want to build Python packages using AI assistance—no software engineering experience required.

## 🎯 What is this?

This template gives you a clean starting structure for building Python packages with AI tools like GitHub Copilot. It includes:
- Basic Python package structure 
- Example code showing best practices
- Test setup with pytest
- **Comprehensive AI instructions** to guide development

It's designed to be **simple enough to understand** but **complete enough to build on**.

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 steps)

### 1. Create your repository
Click "Use this template" on GitHub, or clone and rename this repo.

### 2. Set up your environment
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 3. Customize and start building
```bash
# Rename the package (example)
mv src/package_name src/my_package

# Update pyproject.toml with your details
# Then start coding!
```

**Read [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) for detailed setup instructions.**

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

This template is optimized for working with GitHub Copilot and other AI assistants. The key workflow is:

1. **Assess** - Ask Copilot to examine your current code
2. **Plan** - Get an itemized plan before implementation  
3. **Implement** - Build features step by step
4. **Test** - Verify each change works
5. **Review** - Get code review from AI after major changes
6. **Record** - Key findings are saved to [docs/ground_truths.md](docs/ground_truths.md) so context persists across sessions

**See [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md)** - This file contains detailed instructions that tell Copilot how to help you effectively.

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
pytest                              # Run all tests
pytest --cov=src/package_name      # With coverage report
pytest -v                           # Verbose output
```

## 💡 Tips for Getting Started

1. **Start simple** - Replace the example code with one function you need
2. **Describe your project** - Fill out [docs/project.md](docs/project.md) to help Copilot understand what you're building
3. **Let AI help** - Ask Copilot to assess and plan before implementing
4. **Test as you go** - Run pytest after each feature
5. **Keep ground truths** - Key findings are logged in [docs/ground_truths.md](docs/ground_truths.md) so AI remembers context between sessions
6. **Commit often** - Small commits are easier to track
7. **Read the AI instructions** - [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md) explains the recommended workflow

## 🆘 Getting Help

- **Ask Copilot directly**: "Assess my code and suggest next steps"
- **Read the getting started guide**: [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md)
- **Check the example code**: See [src/package_name/cli.py](src/package_name/cli.py) for a simple CLI pattern
